  # Calls the backends to do the actual lookup.
  #
  # The _scope_ can be anything that responds to `[]`, if you have input
  # data like a Puppet Scope that does not you can wrap that data in a
  # class that has a `[]` method that fetches the data from your source.
  # See hiera-puppet for an example of this.
  #
  # The order-override will insert as first in the hierarchy a data source
  # of your choice.
  #
  # Possible values for the _resolution_type_ parameter:
  #
  # - _:priority_ - This is the default. First found value is returned and no merge is performed
  # - _:array_ - An array merge lookup assembles a value from every matching level of the hierarchy. It retrieves all
  #     of the (string or array) values for a given key, then flattens them into a single array of unique values.
  #     If _priority_ lookup can be thought of as a “default with overrides” pattern, _array_ merge lookup can be though
  #     of as “default with additions.”
  # - _:hash_ - A hash merge lookup assembles a value from every matching level of the hierarchy. It retrieves all of
  #     the (hash) values for a given key, then merges the hashes into a single hash. Hash merge lookups will fail with
  #     an error if any of the values found in the data sources are strings or arrays. It only works when every value
  #     found is a hash. The actual merge behavior is determined by looking up the keys `:merge_behavior` and
  #     `:deep_merge_options` in the Hiera config. `:merge_behavior` can be set to `:deep`, :deeper` or `:native`
  #     (explained in detail below).
  # - _{ deep merge options }_ - Configured values for `:merge_behavior` and `:deep_merge_options`will be completely
  #     ignored. Instead the _resolution_type_ will be a `:hash` merge where the `:merge_behavior` will be the value
  #     keyed by `:behavior` in the given hash and the `:deep_merge_options` will be the remaining top level entries of
  #     that same hash.
  #
  # Valid behaviors for the _:hash_ resolution type:
  #
  # - _native_ - Performs a simple hash-merge by overwriting keys of lower lookup priority.
  # - _deeper_ - In a deeper hash merge, Hiera recursively merges keys and values in each source hash. For each key,
  #     if the value is:
  #        - only present in one source hash, it goes into the final hash.
  #        - a string/number/boolean and exists in two or more source hashes, the highest priority value goes into
  #          the final hash.
  #        - an array and exists in two or more source hashes, the values from each source are merged into a single
  #          array and de-duplicated (but not automatically flattened, as in an array merge lookup).
  #        - a hash and exists in two or more source hashes, the values from each source are recursively merged, as
  #          though they were source hashes.
  #        - mismatched between two or more source hashes, we haven’t validated the behavior. It should act as
  #          described in the deep_merge gem documentation.
  # - _deep_ - In a deep hash merge, Hiera behaves the same as for _deeper_, except that when a string/number/boolean
  #     exists in two or more source hashes, the lowest priority value goes into the final hash. This is considered
  #     largely useless and should be avoided. Use _deeper_ instead.
  #
  # The _merge_ can be given as a hash with the mandatory key `:strategy` to denote the actual strategy. This
  # is useful for the `:deeper` and `:deep` strategy since they can use additional options to control the behavior.
  # The options can be passed as top level keys in the `merge` parameter when it is a given as a hash. Recognized
  # options are:
  #
  #  - 'knockout_prefix' Set to string value to signify prefix which deletes elements from existing element. Defaults is _undef_
  #  - 'sort_merged_arrays' Set to _true_ to sort all arrays that are merged together. Default is _false_
  #  - 'unpack_arrays' Set to string value used as a deliminator to join all array values and then split them again. Default is _undef_
  #  - 'merge_hash_arrays' Set to _true_ to merge hashes within arrays. Default is _false_
  #
  # @param key [String] The key to lookup
  # @param default [Object,nil] The value to return when there is no match for _key_
  # @param scope [#[],nil] The scope to use for the lookup
  # @param order_override [#[]] An override that will considered the first source of lookup
  # @param resolution_type [String,Hash<Symbol,String>] Symbolic resolution type or deep merge configuration
  # @return [Object] The found value or the given _default_ value
